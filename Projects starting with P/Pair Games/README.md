# Pair Games

Pair Games is a Memory matching game that tests the memory capabilities of the user. This game also tests the approach to solving the game.

#### There are basically two concepts on which the game is best.

1\. There are a given number of cards on the table facing down.

2\. The player needs to find all the pairs.

#### The Score of the game is counted in two forms:-

* Time taken by the user to finish the game by matching all the pairs.
* Number of moves required to match all the pairs
