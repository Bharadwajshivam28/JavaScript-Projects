## Step 1 : Create an issue
- You can create an issue and can start working on it once we assign it.

## Step 2 : Fork the Project

- Create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in upstream remote.

- ```$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/JavaScript-Projects.git```

- ```$ cd JavaScript-Projects```

- ```$ git remote add upstream ```https://github.com/Shweta2024/JavaScript-Projects.git
  
  
## Step 3 : Branch
 
- Create a new branch.

- The name of the branch should be the project name followed by issue number.(Example : Calculator20)

- This will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch.

- ```$ git checkout -b branch_name```
 
## Step 4 : Work on the assigned issue
  
## Step 5 : Add all the required files

- This will add all the files (```$ git add .```)

- This will add the file with name fileName(```$ git add <fileName>```)
  
## Step 6 : Commit

- Write a short and good commit message.

- ```$ git commit -m "message"```

## Step 7 : Push all the changes to the current Branch
  
- ```$ git push -u origin Branch_Name```

## Step 8 : Pull Request

- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. 

- Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution. Make them **meaningful** so that we can understand them better.

- After your PR gets merged, **Delete the branch** in which you raise the PR as a good practice üòé
