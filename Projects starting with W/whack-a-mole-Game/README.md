# whack-a-mole

I think everyone has once in his lifetime played this game. A standard Whack-A-Mole machine has a waist-level cabinet with a play area and a display screen, as well as a huge, soft black mallet. Five holes in the top of the play area are stuffed with small plastic moles that appear at random. Whacking each mole as it appears earns you points. The higher the score, the faster the reaction. To create this game, one has to keep in mind these functions-

A function that generates a random length of time for the mole to peep.
A function that selects a random hole for the mole to peep from.
Using the two functions above, create a function to make the mole emerge out of the random hole.
A start-up function for the game.
